Consider a scenario of demand paged memory. Page table is held in registers. It takes
8 milliseconds to service a page fault if an empty page is available or the replaced page is not
modified and 20 milliseconds if the replaced page is modified. Memory access time is 100
nanoseconds. Assume that the page to be replaced is modified 70 percent of the time. Generate a
solution to find maximum acceptable page-fault rate for access time that is not more than 200
nanoseconds.K1617_11614427_B42_OSCA3

nanoseconds.


Solution
We know how to find an effective access time (EAT) for a given page-fault rate (p). 
Here, we have to find 'p' for given 'EAT' so we set up the following equation and solve for 'p':
(Note: 1 millisecond = 1,000,000 nanoseconds = 1e6 nanoseconds)
Time taken to service page Fault for empty page or unmodified page = 8ms.
Time taken to service page Fault for modified page = 20ms
Memory access time = 100ns
Effective Access time = 200ns
      EAT = (1-p)*(100) + (p)*(100 + (1-.7)*(8msec) + (.7)*(20msec))   
	  = 100 - 100p + 100p + (2.4e6)*p + (14e6)*p
	  = 100 + (16.4e6)*p
      200 = 100 + (16.4e6)*p
      p = 100/16.4e6 = 6.0975609756097560975609756097561e-6 ~ 6.01e-6

  Question4 :The Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, .... Formally, it can be expressed as:
f ib0 = 0
f ib1 = 1
f ibn = f ibn−1 + f ibn−2
Write a multithreaded program that generates the Fibonacci sequence. This program should work as follows: On the command line, the user will enter the number of Fibonacci numbers that the program is to generate. The program will then create a separate thread that will generate the Fibonacci numbers, placing the sequence in data that can be shared by the threads (an array is probably the most convenient data structure). When the thread finishes execution, the parent thread will output the sequence generated by the child thread. Because the
parent thread cannot begin outputting the Fibonacci sequence until the child thread finishes, the parent thread will have to wait for the child thread to finish.
